# MemPrO
Membrain Protein Orientation in Lipid Bilayers

## Installation
TBD

>pip install MemPrO

There may be additional steps after this to deal with paths

## Outputs

MemPrO is intended to be run on PDB files, and will output the following:

  * orientation.txt : This is a file that contains general information about all of the final minima. In general Rank_1 is the best orientation, however there are cases where this is not true. orientation.txt can then be used to determine the best orientaion.
  *
